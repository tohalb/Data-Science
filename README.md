# Data-Science
Data Science course project
This was based around 'Fundopoly' - a project for schools in which teams of students (virtually) buy and sell shares over a given period.
At the end of the trading period, the team with the highest profit is the winner. The results for 2014 were available online when I did the course in 2015.

In brief: the project trained on data prior to the trading period and then ran through trading for the same period as the Fundopoly period. 
The project achieved a profit, even allowing for trading costs - but not enough to make me want to bet my house on it!

In order to use both Python and R, Python was used for the 'data processing' elements (retrieving trading data, loading it into databases etc.)
and R was used for the machine learning elements.

Comments from course tutors: 

Presentation:
Nice presentation. You get across all of your key points. I especially like the story you tell with the consideration of trading fees.

Paper:
Nice project Tom.

Your approach is simple, but appropriate for the method and you provide a very good discussion around your problem area.
